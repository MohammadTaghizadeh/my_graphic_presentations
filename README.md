# My graphic presentations
It's a collection of scientific plots and we can say graphic presentations.

It's a circlize plot for the relationship between species and sepal-length of iris data. circlize package is awesome. 
I clustered sepal-length data into 5 clusters.

The power of SVM which has been done with R.

Gene and protein mapping as a beautiful way to find and understand biological sequences. Another power of R.

The power of bioinformatics: molecular dynamics simulation see how much this technique is good to find real data. It is a comparison between B-factor and MD RMSF. 



![PCA_01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66325392/211212132-b52bbfa1-2130-4d1d-81f6-46c31c06d138.jpg)


The beauty of PCA with R. It's for Boston data.
